        <label>Suspend:</label>

        <p class="narrow">
            Suspends all ETM controller operations. A suspended controller will not reconfigure
            the load balancer or update the web tier. Only an active controller may be suspended.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="field">

        <label>Resume:</label>

        <p class="narrow">
            Resumes normal ETM controller operations. Upon resuming, the controller will update
            the load balancer and web tier with any pending changes. Only a suspended controller
            may be resumed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
        <label>Load default tokens:</label>

        <p class="narrow">
            Loads default URL token definitions from the default-url-tokens.xml file, located in the /WEB-INF directory.
            The default tokens will replace all existing tokens. This operation is useful when initially deploying ETM
            to a new environment, but keep in mind that it will unconditionally overwrite the currently active tokens.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
        <label>Update load balancer:</label>

        <p class="narrow">
            Forces an update of the load balancer configuration. This is the same operation ETM executes automatically
            whenever changes are detected in the set of online client applications. Updating the load balancer on demand
            should only be required in unusual circumstances, but it is a safe operation that can be performed at any
            time. This is the first operation to try if any of ETM's internal data is out of sync with the load balancer
            or the deployed Apache rules.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
        <label>Reset Apache rules:</label>

        <p class="narrow">
            Forces the recreation and redeployment of Apache rewrite rules. ETM normally updates Apache rules in an
            incremental fashion to maintain relationships among conflicting or potentially conflicting (i.e. "blocked")
            rules. This operation, however, recreates the entire set of rules without regard to the current rule
            relationships. This operation should only be performed if a forced update of the load balancer fails to
            genenerate or deploy a valid set of Apache rules.
